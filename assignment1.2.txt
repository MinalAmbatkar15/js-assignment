Difference between var and let in JavaScript

var and let are both used for variable declaration in javascript but the difference between them is that var is function scoped and let is block scoped.
It can be said that a variable declared with var is defined throughout the program as compared to let.

<html> 
  
<body> 
    <script> 
        // calling x after definition 
        var x = 5; 
        document.write(x, "\n"); 
  
        // calling y after definition  
        let y = 10; 
        document.write(y, "\n"); 
  
        // calling var z before definition will return undefined 
        document.write(z, "\n"); 
        var z = 2; 
  
        // calling let a before definition will give error 
        document.write(a); 
        let a = 3; 
    </script> 
</body> 
  
</html>     

CONST :

This declaration creates a constant whose scope can be either global or local to the block in which it is declared. Global constants do not become properties of the
 window object, unlike var variables.
An initializer for a constant is required. You must specify its value in the same statement in which it's declared. 

The const declaration creates a read-only reference to a value. It does not mean the value it holds is immutableâ€”just that the variable identifier cannot be reassigned.
 For instance, in the case where the content is an object, this means the object's contents (e.g., its properties) can be altered.
const number = 42;

try {
  number = 99;
} catch (err) {
  console.log(err);
  // expected output: TypeError: invalid assignment to const `number'
  // Note - error messages will vary depending on browser
}

console.log(number);
// expected output: 42
